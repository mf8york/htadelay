# Sequential Experimentation with Delay

DRAFT IN PROGRESS

This repository contains Matlab code which implements several contributions from the paper:

'A Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Model of Sequential Experimentation with Delayed Response' 

by Stephen E. Chick, Martin Forster, and Paolo Pertile (2015, in submission).

The code computes optimal stopping times for sequential experiments when samples are observed with delay. The code includes:

 - constructor and validator methods for creating problem instances
 - computation of the optimal PDE solution for stage II sampling, and for stage I sampling 
 - drivers for monte carlo simulations
 - the code computes quite a few other things which are not included in the paper.
 
 Analysis assumes a known sampling variance and other assumptions from the paper.

# Workflow

1. Download the matlab code from this repo. When installed locally, there should be files DelayDriver.m and two directories, 'delaycore' and 'delaypaper', and potentially several other files.
2. [Optional] Update the LocalDelaySetPaths.m file to contain local directory information to set the path to the matlab code for the computations if you intend to run the code in a nonstandard directory structure.
3. Run matlab and set the current directory to the base repo.
4. Open the file DelayDriver.m. It contains a sequence of chunks of code which illustrate how the interface to the routines works.
5. Copy the chunks of code identified in DelayDriver.m into the matlab console.
6. Enjoy the plots.

# Comment on simulations

1. Smooth curves (potentially with a few jumps or discontinuties) in plots are computed from the free boundary PDE of the continuous time approximation.
2. Jagged curves represent output from Monte Carlo (MC) results.
    a. MC results labeled 'Bayesian' means that sample paths were generated by assuming the given value of mu0 on the plot is the prior mean for sampling unknown means W_i from the prior distrubution.
    b. MC results label 'Frequentist' or 'Freq.' means that sample paths were run by fixing all W_i to the value of mu0 on the axis
    The values of mu0 are then varied for both of those types of plots.
